OE layer building toolchains & tools for MCUs
-----------------------------------------------
This layer was created to build development tools for microcontrollers. Since building of native toolchain is necessary
it is possible to ship binaries compiled from source into images.

Supported MCU:
----------------------
* [Microchip (Atmel formerly) AVR](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit/avr-mcus)

Layer dependencies:
----------------------
see [layer.conf](conf/layer.conf) for dependencies and [Layer-index](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/) where to find layers


Contributing
------------
* Submit any patches against the `meta-microcontroller` layer by using the GitHub pull-request feature.


Policies
--------
* **Please do not send private emails to maintainer - they will not be answered anymore**. For bug-reports/questions/suggestions.. use [issues](https://github.com/schnitzeltony/meta-microcontroller/issues).
* Pull requests should follow [OE-Styleguide](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Styleguide) with the following additions:
  * Use 4 spaces for indentation always (shell and python code)
  * For splitting of long list values use four-space indentation on sucessive lines and prefer the closing quote as the first character ([OE-Styleguide](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Styleguide) - second example)
  * Pull-requests with patches fixing issues for musl, clang or gold-linker are accepeted only if patches have upstream-status "Applied" or "Backport" and contain a link to the upstream patch.
